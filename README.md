# Rowboat Simulation
A single scull racing shell simulated in Unity. A work-in-progress. Basic rowing physics and controls have been completed, and the next step is to add wind and wave physics to the boat. The eventual goal is to turn the boat into a pair, with networked controls and physics.

The rowboat and oars were modeled in blender by myself.

For a build, see [https://canarybenn.itch.io/rowboat-simulator](https://canarybenn.itch.io/rowboat-simulator).

## Controls
Use a gamepad with two joysticks. Press the East button to toggle grabbing the oars, and use the bumpers to drop or lift the oars in/out of the water. Joysticks control oar movement. The game has only been tested on a Logitech F310.
